# Minecraft 1.19 Teleportation & Auto-Fishing Mod (Fabric)

Welcome to the repository for our simple Minecraft mod built on the Fabric platform, designed specifically for version 1.19! This project introduces teleportation and auto-fishing functionalities.

## Purpose

This modding venture was primarily educational. It stemmed from a curiosity to explore:

- **Vulnerabilities Exploitation**: By tweaking the core mechanics of Minecraft, we wanted to get a grasp of how applications could be vulnerable to unintended interactions.
  
- **Reverse Engineering**: Minecraft is a complex application. By creating a mod, we dive deep into its codebase, enabling us to better understand its workings and the very essence of reverse engineering.

While this might sound a bit serious, remember, this is a pet project! It's all about learning and having fun while doing so.

## Features

1. **Teleportation**: Quickly teleport to a saved location or a set coordinate.
2. **Auto-Fishing**: Let the mod do the fishing for you while you sit back and relax.
